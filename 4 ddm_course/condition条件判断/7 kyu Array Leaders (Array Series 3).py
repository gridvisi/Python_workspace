arrayLeaders ({1, 2, 3, 4, 0}) ==> return {4}
Explanation:
4 is greater than the sum all the elements to its right side

Note : The last element 0 is equal to right sum of its elements (abstract zero).

arrayLeaders ({16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2}) ==> return {17, 5, 2}
Explanation:
17 is greater than the sum all the elements to its right side

5 is greater than the sum all the elements to its right side

Note : The last element 2 is greater than the sum of its right elements (abstract zero).

arrayLeaders ({5, 2, -1}) ==> return {5, 2}
Explanation:
5 is greater than the sum all the elements to its right side

2 is greater than the sum all the elements to its right side

Note : The last element -1 is less than the sum of its right elements (abstract zero).

arrayLeaders ({0, -1, -29, 3, 2}) ==> return {0, -1, 3, 2}
Explanation:
0 is greater than the sum all the elements to its right side

-1 is greater than the sum all the elements to its right side

3 is greater than the sum all the elements to its right side

Note : The last element 2 is greater than the sum of its right elements (abstract zero).
