Bill Gates:  So, how is heaven, Steve?
Steve Jobs:  Great! It just doesn't have any wall or fence.
Bill Gates:  So...?
Steve Jobs:  So, we don't need any Windows and Gates. I'm sorry, Bill, I didn't mean to offend you.
Bill Gates:  It's ok Steve, but I heard a rumour.
Steve Jobs:  Oh, what rumour?
Bill Gates:  That nobody is allowed to touch Apple there, and there are no Jobs in heaven.
Steve Jobs:  Oh no, definitely there are, but only no-pay Jobs. Therefore definitely no Bill in Heaven...
