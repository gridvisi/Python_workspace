'''
Given an integer N, the task is convert and print the binary equaiva;ent of N.
Examples:


Input: N = 13
Output: 1101
Input: N = 15
Output: 1111

Time Complexity: O(logN)
Auxiliary Space: O(logN)

# Python3 implementation of the approach

# Recursive function to convert n
# to its binary equivalent
def decimalToBinary(n):
    # Base case
    if (n == 0):
        print("0", end="")
        return

    # Recursive call
    decimalToBinary(n // 2)
    print(n % 2, end="")


# Driver code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = 13
    decimalToBinary(n)
