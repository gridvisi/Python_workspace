Yeah, but Russia and Canada are almost empty (as is western China to be fair). I can also make the Netherlands, Belgium and the Ruhr area in Germany red and all of Canada Orange. Yeah coastal China is insanely populated, but a Mercator projection of mostly empty tracks of land is a weird way of showing this.

How is this anti-Chinese? From what I can gather it's solely to convey the density of China's population because its high population is interesting. If people want to draw their own conclusions from it that's their prerogative, but attributing scare tactics to a population comparison map just seems overboard. By damaging meaningfulness they probably just mean adding a "+0" to a statistic wouldn't really add to what a graph is showing.


To elaborate on u/Le_German_Face’s points: I’ll give OP the ignoring of India, whose population is only ~100M (edited because I misread) behind China’s. But the OP appears to leave out more highly populated countries in Africa and Asia in favour of including more of Europe. At least, that is if we go by the populations reported in OP’s 2019 source. By picking and choosing what countries to include, the map visually appears to unify the West and then compare it to China.

So, might as well include Antarctica, because the rest of the countries that have been included appear to also have been chosen arbitrarily.

You seem to overlook the context?

How can one ignore this piece of work and it's setup when barely a day passes by without another chinese horror story in american media?



Where did you get that number? India is behind around 100 million people and won't surpass China in population for another decade.

How is this anti-Chinese?

Yeah wait a little. I'll carry together all material concerning chinese population levels and how they threaten the "unified" west.


I assume the color was taken from their flag, which should always be fine. Of course the communist reaction called the Red Scare used to be a thing, so that could add a bit of menace to older Americans perception of the color.


no, antarctica isnt that big, it just look big in this map

Which would be orange.

"almost double" - thats what the guy i answered to said. obviously my comment was in relation to the comment i replied to and antarctica is just not that big that "almost double" is even close to true



[–]HerbziKalOC: 1 18 指標 2 年前 
Obviously the guy you answered to was talking about this map. Making Antarctica on this map orange would almost double the amount of orange on this map. Seems weird to randomly start talking about it in the context of actual landmass size.




Seems weird to care about how much orange there is on a map that skews land mass. It's like you want to be led on just to see more of the color orange? Rather than an actual comparison

This would have been more informative if, instead of using country borders, the prefecture or state borders were used. Then you would see how severely concentrated the population actually is in China.

Would be more manipulative too, as you could trim most of Russia the same way.



[–]Dawidko1200 8 指標 2 年前 
That's not manipulative, that's just more objective. The biggest region in Russia has a population density of 0.3 people per square kilometre. And the majority of it is much the same. So "trimming" it by prefecture would make perfect sense in showing a more objective image.



[–]PandaDerZwote 4 指標 2 年前 
It depends on what kind of picture you want to paint, really. Cutting out the parts of China that aren't super densely populated but leaving those parts in for other countries (like Russia) makes China appear much more densely populated than it is. If you do that for China, you should do it for other countries as well, as to compare densely packed regions around the globe, but doing it for one country, but not the others is misleading.

It all depends on what story someone wants to tell with any graph or image like this.



[–]zipadeedodog 11 指標 2 年前 
China and India have roughly the same population. Color in India blue and change headline to read "Red and orange and blue areas have equal populations".

And make Antarctica orange.

If people take this more as a political representation and less of a geographical one, it becomes much more interesting. It’s highlighting a lot of countries that we hear in the news, and we have a tendency to equate them. So we hear about the leadership, sports figures, scientists from Australia, Russia, USA, Brazil, China, Germany, and we think it’s all on the same scale.

But it’s fascinating - when China doesn’t go to the World Cup, that’s wild when you see their population lined up compared to all these countries. When you hear news that China is increasing their cheese consumption, that has huge ramifications for the rest of the world.

People are bad with large numbers, so this is a great way to show just how big China’s population is.

Mercator is not a great choice here. You’re trying to make a point about relative areas but chose a projection that is notorious for how much it skews/misrepresents area.

Edit: it’s not actually Mercator. My bad. That said it still has area distortion. So everything else I said still applies.

Isn't this some other projection?



[–]dhkendall 16 指標 2 年前 
Plus this is not a map making a point about area but rather population.



[–]Tahoma-sans 33 指標 2 年前 
But it does make a point about how a larger area has the same population as a smaller area. Using a projection that better shows the areas would have been more useful.



[–]pyropulse209 12 指標 2 年前 
It isn’t showing population concentration by area, but rather population concentration by country. The projection is perfectly fine for the latter.



[–]bcolsaf 10 指標 2 年前 
The title is “red and orange areas have equal populations” so I’m not sure how you can say it’s not about population concentration by area. Its right there in the title.

Looks like most of the countries you selected were big countries with populations in the ten millions.

You could have went from bottom to top, and highlighted the 157 least populated UN-member countries and they would still have a smaller population than China, combined.

[–]sittinginaboat 10 指標 2 年前 
Interesting, but the perspective is off. The map projection used makes the areas closer to the poles seem larger than equal areas near the equator. China is closer to the equator than most of the orange-tinted countries, so the discrepancy is exaggerated somewhat.

A side effect of using this projection is that Africa seems much smaller than it actually is, compared to other continents.

[–]aguafiestas 2 指標 2 年前 
To me the fact that so many countries are left I colored makes it less compelling, especially since the orange countries are not contiguous and weirdly skip Central and part of South America.

I think a more interesting map would be to color in enough of Asia to get half the world population and color that red and the rest orange.



[–]cvdvds 1 指標 2 年前 
And they could've picked much, much more sparsely populated countries (all of Africa, Oceania, Antartica and then some for example) if they solely went for the wow-factor. Probably end up with most of the the map being orange.

Seems they picked some well-known, fairly important countries which makes for an interesting map, IMO.



[–]loulanOC: 1 4 指標 2 年前 
They picked as many Western countries as they could.



[–]Sangwiny 2 指標 2 年前 
It would be more interesting to have the entire map colored. Just color China, India, Indonesia and maybe few others red while rest of the world orange. That would paint the perspective of population concetration in a much better comparison.

"red and orange areas have the same population"

There's the red area, and the orange area. The orange area is all of the countries in orange. The red area is china. It's an entirely unambiguous statement.



[–]Morgowitch 0 指標 2 年前 
It says 'the orange areaS'. It is ambiguous.



[–]tiggerbiggo 1 指標 2 年前 
That's not ambiguous at all. It also doesn't say "the orange areas" it says "the red and orange areas".

It's ((red and orange) areas) not ((red) and (orange areas)). You can't just put half the title out of context.
