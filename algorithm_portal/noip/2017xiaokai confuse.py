Number Theory Level 2
数论二级

XiaoKai has two kinds of coins whose values are coprime integers. For each kind, he can use as many as needed. It's been proven that if the price of something is large enough, XiaoKai can always pay the exact amount just by using these two kinds of coins.
小开有两种硬币，它们的值是互质整数。对于每一种，他都可以根据需要使用。事实证明，如果某件东西的价格足够大，小凯只要用这两种硬币就可以支付确切的金额。
If a and b are the two coprime integers, what is the maximum price of something he can't pay exactly?
如果a和b是两个互质整数，那么他不能支付的最高价格是多少？

a×b+a−b
a×b−a+b
a×b+a+b
a×b−a−b
