Hector the hacker has stolen some information, but it is encrypted.
In order to decrypt it, he needs to write a function that will generate a decryption
key from the encryption key which he stole (it is in hexadecimal). To do this, he
has to determine the two prime factors P, and Q of the encyption key, and return the product (P - 1)x(Q - 1).
For example if the encryption key is "47b", it is 1147 in base ten. this factors to 31x37, so the key Hector
needs is 1080 (30x36).
