'''
The game is equivalent to Ozzy and Pete flipping a coin 1010 times each and Pete
getting an additional toss in case they both get the same number of tails.

By symmetry, they both are equally likely to win in the first 1010 tosses.
The last toss is also symmetric: if it's a tail, Pete wins, and if it's a head,
Ozzy wins. This means that they're equally likely to win.
