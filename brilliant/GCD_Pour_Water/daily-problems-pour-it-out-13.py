Today's Challenge
You have two empty containers â€” one that holds 99 liters
and the other that holds 11.2511.25 liters.



Using these moves:

completely fill a container from the tap
completely empty a container onto the ground
pour a container into the other until it's completely full or
the one pouring is completely empty,\\[-0.7em]
\\[-0.6em]
which one of the following amounts can you measure out exactly?

Hint: What's the smallest amount you can measure?
